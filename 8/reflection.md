# Reflection

## Day 8: Phonebook

*Language: Python*

*IDE: Coderunner*


### Solving the problem

Identify the subtasks! In this instance we were to:

- Store `n` number of names and phone numbers
- Print entry for name query
- If not found, print Not found instead

### Python

- *Detecting end of input from stdin*: `for line in sys.stdin:`
- *Exception handling*: `try:...except:`
