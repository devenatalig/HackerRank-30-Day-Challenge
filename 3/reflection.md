## Day 3: Conditional Statements

*Language: Java*

*IDE: HackerRank in Browser IDE*


### Solving the problem

Identify the subtasks! In this instance we were to:

Given an integer, `n`, perform the following conditional actions:
If `n` is odd, print Weird
If `n` is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If `n` is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If `n` is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird


### Switch-case vs. if

Use switch case if looking for a specific value (x=1 or a='hello world') not when using logical operators. For determining if a statement is `true` of `false` us if statements.
