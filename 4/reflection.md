## Day 4: Classes vs. Instances

*Language: Java*

*IDE: CodeRunner*


### Solving the problem

Identify the subtasks! In this instance we were to:

- Write a Person class with an instance variable `age`
- Write a constructor that assigns the persons age if the parameter `initialAge` is greater than 0, otherwise set age to 0 and print `Age is not valid, setting age to 0.`
- Write an instance method `yearPasses()` that increments the person's age
- Write an instance method `amIOld()` which:
	- Prints `You are young.` if `age < 13`
	- Prints `You are a teenager.` if `age â‰¥ 13` and `age < 18`
	- Otherwise prints `You are old.`
